This bot downloads company financial records from the Bank of Thailand, as provided at https://www.bot.or.th/English/FinancialInstitutions/WebsiteFI/Pages/InstList.aspx.

Note:

1. There is not obviously any licence numbering scheme - ie there is no useful primary key for these records, other than the (fragile) name of the entity

2. Although the BOT makes available a list of "Closed" licences, this bot does not download those records

3. The BOT provides a separate list of officers associated with each licensed company (https://www.bot.or.th/English/FinancialInstitutions/PruReg_HB/CPC/Pages/CPC_by_Financial_Institutions.aspx), however this bot does not use that data.
